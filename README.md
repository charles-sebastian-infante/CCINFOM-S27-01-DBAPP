# Bus Terminal Management System

A comprehensive database application for managing bus terminal operations including ticket sales, route scheduling, and fleet management.

## Project Information

**Course:** CCINFOM Database Application Project  
**Academic Year:** 2025-2026, Term 1  
**Institution:** De La Salle University

## Team Members

- **GUARIN, Raine Louise R.** - Terminal Management & Ticket Purchase
- **INFANTE, Charles Sebastian V.** - Route Management & Bus Departure Process  
- **MIRANDA, Bien Aouien C.** - Ticket Management & Bus Assignment
- **RANARA, Ramil Carlos B.** - Bus Management & Schedule Creation

## Project Overview

This system addresses the limitations of Excel-based bus terminal operations by providing:

- **Real-time ticket management** with capacity tracking
- **Multi-terminal coordination** for route scheduling
- **Automated fare calculation** with discount handling
- **Fleet management** with bus assignment and tracking
- **Comprehensive reporting** for operational insights

## System Features

### Core Record Management
- **Terminal Records** - Location and operational details
- **Bus Records** - Fleet information and status tracking
- **Ticket Records** - Passenger bookings with departure details
- **Route Records** - Origin/destination pairs with fare structure

### Key Transactions
1. **Ticket Purchase Process** - Complete booking workflow with capacity validation
2. **Bus Departure Process** - Passenger manifest and status updates
3. **Ticket Cancellation** - Refund processing with policy enforcement
4. **Route Schedule Creation** - Bus and driver assignment to routes

### Reporting Capabilities
- Terminal revenue analysis (daily/monthly)
- Route performance metrics
- Payment method summaries
- Bus utilization tracking
